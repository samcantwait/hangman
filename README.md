# Hangman Categories
A classic hangman game.    
Choose words from a variety of categories.  
Hints are generated through API calls (except in the National Park category, where they are hard coded in).

This game was made using javascript and styled with css.   
There is no longer a drawing of a hanging man, however, the number of guesses remaining are displayed on the page.
